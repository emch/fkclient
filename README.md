fkclient repository

fkclient is an indie project to make a voxel game (like Minecraft) with PvP purposes.
fk stands for Fallen Kingdoms which is an existing type of gameplay invented by some Minecraft players.
The goal is to create a game to that purpose only.

Used language is Freebasic.
Used libraries are :
- OpenGL
- SDL
- Extended FreeBasic library
- winsock

A server (fkserver) will be developed to allow multiplayer, of course.

To open the project, use fbedit and open the .fbp file. If you want to participate, please contact me.
