fkclient repository

fkclient is an indie project to make a voxel game (like Minecraft) with PvP purposes.
fk stands for Fallen Kingdoms which is an existing type of gameplay invented by some Minecraft players.
The goal is to create a game to that purpose only.

Used language is Freebasic.
Used libraries are :
- OpenGL
- SDL
- Extended FreeBasic library
- winsock

A server (fkserver) will be developed to allow multiplayer, of course.

To open the project, use fbedit and open the .fbp file. If you want to participate, please contact me.

running fkclient 0.0.0
======================

The executable is located in the "Build" folder. If not textures appear and the game somehow crashes, this means that the game cannot access the textures folder. Find the "Res" folder and copy it entirely in the folder where the executable lies. Do not move any file (especially DLLs) from the "Build" folder.

fkclient 0.0.0 was successfully tested on (C)Windows 7 and (C)Windows XP.
