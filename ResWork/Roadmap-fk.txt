- Chunk rendering optimization
- POssibility to manage different textures for up face and other faces (cf. grass)
- Finish drawing main textures (dirt, brick, …) see minecraft.png

- Random chunk generation (from seed)
- Multiple chunks management (and real-time chunk generation for non-visited parts of the world)
- Chunks loading from binary file

Algo :
-- Load a given number of chunks around current position (camera then player) with max/min altitude
-- Load chunks from file
-- If chunk corresponding to position doesn't exist, generate chunk randomly (first: without any probability settings)
-- Save chunks in binary file


- Surlignage du voxel sélectionné (raytracing)

- Collisions
- Model loading (simple cube then character) + texture loading
- Model animation (skeleton)
- World simple generation
- World complete generation
- Lighting
- Gravity
- Sound
- Menu management
- FileSystem Manager

- Use SDL_types everywhere?
